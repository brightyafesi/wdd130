            <p>Our themes from the home page could be protrayed in a variety of good story telling narratives<br> 
                Here we present to you one such narrative for each theme from the homepage. 
                And these are longer than normal log lines (extended log lines) which are still snippets to give sample content 
                of what the plots of bigger structured screenplays would be focused on.

                    Character X is a fitness and martial arts expert who after experiencing a series of falling a victim of mediocre self-defence
                    from average standard schools, brought more harm than good in big threat scenarios. 
                    And made multiple failed attempts of finding a martial arts school which counter the big realistic threats out there in the world. 
                    Through circumstances of the hustling experience, 
                    Character X achieved the desired martial arts skills 
                    and as an expert strives to make these skills easily accessible to those who are only exposed to the mediocre self defence skills. 
                    Unlike the popular hero that saves the day, character X not only saves those in danger but also shows them to save themselves out of danger.

                    Character X is a successful down to earth entreprenuer pursuing politics with no political games.
                    Having endured the low living standards from the conjested slums facing numerous evictions,
                    in the name of urbanisation, industralisation or modern development.
                    To overcome the political and wealthy world stigma which designates the low class,
                    as useless consumers populating and filling the world, character x emerges a business campaign of transforming the surbubs, slums, ghettos, wastelands from pollution,
                    into recycling hubs and green energy residential parks for the low class. 
                    The business is then a threat and target lobbied against by the big companies. 
                    So character x joins politics to introduce this policy for the benefit of the low class themselves,
                    and as relief from the raising fear of high population (mostly of the poor or low class) and world pollution (mostly by the big companies).

                    Character X is an engineer seeking support for developing robotic equipment for risky work. 
                    After successfully working for a company that grew to manufacture robotic equipment for industrial and commercial use,
                    these machines gradually ended replacing the people's routine jobs and many lost their jobs 
                    while others would find it difficult to get a routine job at the big companies and this had a big negative impact on the society.
                    Although sought by enterprenuers, character x is commited to design equipment for domestic use,
                    and as for industrial and commercial use, the machines are to function as assistance to the workers,
                    and not a replacement. 
                    After receiving commissions by the mining companies which are facing criticism for the fatal working conditions of their workers,
                    character x embarks on developing robotic equipment for assisting the workers in the mines and reduce the casualties.
                    And so character x sets this as a stepping stone to encourage the other big business owners in the rest of the industrial and commercial sector,
                    to remember that the philanthropy from their successes is counter intuitive if it does not start from the consideration of the workers in their companies.</p>

                    Character X is a computer scientist seeking to have computer hackers pursue a positive purpose for their computer skills.
                    When working for a successful software company that develops autonomous computer systems,
                    the company was a target from spyware entities.
                    In addition to other computer companies, spyware entities work to infiltrate their products and 
                    be able to have discreet large scale surveillance and espionage and sell the data to third parties.
                    Character x finds that with the advancement in the Artificial Intelligence industry,
                    when tampered with these discreet third parties, you would have control over the world systems,
                    with a mindless, souless and spiritless entity.
                    Since many of the hackers that are used in these schemes are simply young talents proud of their skills,
                    character x seeks support from the cyber division of law enforcements to recruit (for white hat hacking) instead of jailing the hackers that are tracked down,
                    and also attract amd motivate the hackers out there that positive computer skills are more ingenious than the negative ones.
                    Character x, shows that if these young talents are not utilised by the government,
                    then there skills are not safe out there in the world.
