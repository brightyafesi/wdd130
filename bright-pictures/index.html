                            <p>Insecurity eventually ends down to the individual because law enforcements would not be everywhere all the time. <br>
                                Mediocre self-defence skills which are now becoming more common are a risk to the practitioners if faced with danger. <br>
                                Providing authentic survival skills and regularly improving them reduces the chances of insecurity. <br>
                                And screening the people receiving the training to prevent the wrong people who rather than protecting themselves, 
                                they may instead victimise others. <br>
                                Neglecting military personnel in elite units after their service results to them transferring their skills to elaborate crime.
                                Catering for these people with something like veteran community support programs would be beneficial.

                            <h2>HIGH POPULATION</h2>
                            <p>The main concern for high population is scarcity of resources.High population is more advantageous than disadvantageous, 
                                If the global powers (big governments/ big companies) are less interested in ruling over or controlling the world and more interested in managing it.
                                With environmental conservation and good recycling systems, resources would not be scarce however much the population grows. 
                                The Earth was created to support life in all its diversity. The more the people the greater the creativity and diversity of humanity.

                            <p>
                                The major concern here is that machines will replace humans at work. Machine labour should solve human problems but not make abnormal profits.
                                Machines should replace humans with risky tasks at work like working in mines, harsh environments.And humans should be allocated to the rest of all the less risky tasks at work.

                            <p>
                                Computers will rule the world in the future is one of the speculations that is a major concern.
                                But if taken seriously, Artificial Intelligence is as dangerous as the programmers behind them. 
                                It is the programmers with ambitions to rule the world that attempt to build mailicious programs.  
                                So the concern should not be on computers but on the programmers.
                                Have an environment for ethical programming then you will have ethical artificial intelligence.
