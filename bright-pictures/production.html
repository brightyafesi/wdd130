                            This requires investing a lot of time in research and instruction for fitness and martial arts realistic techniques.
                            These would be inspired from things like Calisthenics, Parkour, Krav maga, e-t-c 
                            with misrepresented styles (like Wu Xi martial arts) in the form of Tai Chi, Wing Chun, e-t-c to demonstrate what is real and fake.
                            Utilising things like, real gun disarming from people like Victor Marx, effective shooting methods like the IDF Isosceles stance method,

                            so the production side plot device of the film would rely on creative crafts.

                            Funding and research would be spent on cheap recycling methods for making creative products from wasted material.
                            Plastic, polythene, paper are all part of garbage material for recycle and design various things in fashion,
                            Utilising Skills and DIY (Do It Yourself) styles from inspirations like the 5 minute crafts channel,

                            as well as SIGINT tools like the XKeyscore.
                            Getting insights from the cyber security industry like the Black Hat Briefings, Security BSides as well as personalities like Keren Elazari,
