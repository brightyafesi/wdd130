        THEMES <br>
        Let us introduce you to some of the themes among the concerns in the world which require a good touch from the film industry. <br> <br>

        Insecurity: <br>
        Insecurity eventually ends down to the individual because law enforcements would not be everywhere all the time. <br>
        Mediocre self-defence skills which are now becoming more common are a risk to the practitioners if faced with danger. <br>
        Providing authentic survival skills and regularly improving them reduces the chances of insecurity. <br>
        And screening the people receiving the training to prevent the wrong people who rather than protecting themselves, 
        they may instead victimise others. <br>
        Neglecting military personnel in elite units after their service results to them transferring their skills to elaborate crime.
        Catering for these people with something like veteran community support programs would be beneficial. <br> <br>

        High Population: <br>
        The main concern for high population is scarcity of resources. <br>
        High population is more advantageous than disadvantageous, 
        If the global powers (big governments/ big companies) are less interested in ruling over or controlling the world 
        and more interested in managing it. <br>
        With environmental conservation and good recycling systems, 
        resources would not be scarce however much the population grows. 
        The Earth was created to support life in all its diversity. 
        The more the people the greater the creativity and diversity of humanity. <br> <br>

        Machine Labour: <br>
        The major concern here is that machines will replace humans at work. <br>
        Machine labour should solve human problems but not make abnormal profits. <br>
        Machines should replace humans with risky tasks at work like working in mines, harsh environments. <br>
        And humans should be allocated to the rest of all the less risky tasks at work. <br/> <br>

        Artificial Intelligence: <br>
        Computers will rule the world in the future is one of the speculations that is major concern.
        But if taken seriously, Artificial Intelligence is as dangerous as the programmers behind them. 
        It is the programmers with ambitions to rule the world that attempt to build mailicious programs.  
        So the concern should not be on computers but on the programmers.
        Have an environment for ethical programming then you will have ethical artificial intelligence. <br>

      </ul>
      <h3>CONTENT</h3>
      <p>
        Our themes from the home page could be protrayed in a variety of good story telling narratives<br> 
        Here we present to you one such narrative for each theme from the homepage. 
        And these are log lines which are snippets to give sample content of what the plots of bigger structured screenplays would be focused on. <br> <br>
        
        Insecurity: <br>
        The insecurity theme could be made under the action film genre. <br>

        Log line: <br>
        Character X is a fitness and martial arts expert who after experiencing a series of falling a victim of mediocre self-defence
        from average standard schools, brought more harm than good in big threat scenarios. 
        And made multiple failed attempts of finding a martial arts school which counter the big realistic threats out there in the world. 
        Through circumstances of the hustling experience, 
        Character X achieved the desired martial arts skills 
        and as an expert strives to make these skills easily accessible to those who are only exposed to the mediocre self defence skills. 
        Unlike the popular hero that saves the day, character X not only saves those in danger but also shows them to save themselves out of danger. <br> <br>

        High Population: <br>        
        The high population theme could be made under the political business drama film genre <br>

        Log line: <br> 
        Character X is a successful down to earth entreprenuer pursuing politics without political games.
        Having endured the low living standards from the conjested slums facing numerous evictions,
        in the name of urbanisation, industralisation or modern development.
        To overcome the political and wealthy world stigma which designates the low class,
        as useless consumers populating and filling the world, character x emerges a business campaign of transforming the surbubs, slums, ghettos, wastelands from pollution,
        into recycling hubs and green energy residential parks for the low class. 
        The business is then a threat and target lobbied against by the wealthy. 
        So character x joins politics to introduce this policy for the benefit of the low class themselves,
        and as relief from the raising fear of high population (mostly of the poor or low class) and world pollution (mostly by the big companies).<br> <br>
        <!--From a background of enduring low living standards in the slums,
        Character x experienced numerous evictions of the poor residents in these conjested slums,
        in name of urbanisation, industralisation or modern development. 
        They would wander and learn to adapt to hustling living conditions in other places.
        In the political and business sphere, 
        these and most of the low class people would be designated as useless consumers populating and filling the world.
        Character x crafted wasted material into useful products and later had a group to eventually become a business workshop
        to supply the low class market at significantly low costs. 
        In the face of the state of the lower class, character x put commitment and dedication into expanding the workshop,
        and use all the creativity, talents and gifts from the people to build most of the requirements needed to sustain these low societies. 
        Since the low class people are the biggest percentage, character x's business became a threat to the larger companies market.
        And attempting to decampaign the business by lobbying its ban by the excuse of unhealthy working standards and products. 
        The drama continues as the business receives health consultations and methodologies motivating character x into a bigger campaign of transforming the waste lands
        polluted by the big companies into advanced recycling hubs and green energy residential parks for the low class world. 
        Character x embarks on joining politics to introduce policies for transforming the ghettos, slums, surbubs, waste lands, e-t-c 
        for the benefit of the poor low class residents themselves as an alternative solution for high population which itself is a diversion of the elite wasting the environment.
        Unlike the fellow visionaries who after bringing change are later blinded by new world they have entered or even when not blinded but later die with their achivements, 
        Character x rests this vision unto the Lord and prepares a trusted potential diversity of successors to grow and progress it even further.--> 

        Machine labour: <br>        
        The machine labour theme could be made under the science fiction business drama film genre. <br>

        Log line: <br>
        Character X is an engineer seeking support for developing robotic equipment for risky work. 
        After successful working for a company that grew to manufacture robotic equipment for industrial and commercial use,
        these machines gradually ended replacing the people's routine jobs and many lost their jobs 
        while others would find it difficult to get a routine job at the big companies and this had a big negative impact on the society.
        Although sought by enterprenuers, character x is commited to design equipment for domestic use,
        and as for industrial and commercial use, the machines are to function as assistance to the workers,
        and not a replacement. 
        After receiving commissions by the mining companies which are facing criticism for the fatal working conditions of their workers,
        character x embarks on developing robotic equipment for assisting the workers in the mines and reduce the casualities.
        And so character x sets this as a stepping stone to encourage the other engineers and business people in the rest of the industrial and commercial sector,
        to remember that the philanthropy from their successes is counter intuitive if it does not start from the consideration of the workers in their companies.  
        <!--works at a successful robotics company making robotic equipment for domestic use.
        The company is so successful that it is also commissioned to design robot equipment for industrial use.
        Since the industrial market is larger and more profitable, the company now focuses on the industrial market.
        The company expands to the commercial market as well so that along with the rest of the robotic companies supply,
        the robotic industry replaces the humans in routine jobs for big companies.
        Character x's dream was for the robotic innovation to simply lives for the future of humanity,
        but now many workers are loosing jobs because of it.
        Character x's concern is dismissed because machine labour is cheaper than human labour.
        Character x is dismissed from work due to the reluctuancy to design more innovations.
        Finding people working in harsh conditions and environments gives character x an idea of making the dream come true.
        Designing robotic equipment for risky tasks, co-working with humans for assistance in less risky tasks and let humans work in no risk tasks at all.
        Character x embarks on introducing this idea and convince the upcoming enterprenuers and influencing government policy to support them.
        Unlike the previous dream of simplifying life but at a cost of the bigger part of humanity,
        Character x extended the dream for the whole of humanity.--> <br> <br>

        Artificial intelligence: <br>
        The Artificial Intelligence theme could be made under the science fiction crime film genre. <br>
      
        Log line: <br>
        Character X is a computer scientist seeking to have computer hackers pursue a positive purpose for their computer skills.
        When working for a successful software company that develops autonomous computer systems,
        the company was a target from spyware entities.
        In addition to other computer companies, spyware entities work to infiltrate their products and 
        be able to have discreet large scale surveillance and espionage and sell the data to third parties.
        Character x finds that with the advancement in the Artificial Intelligence industry,
        when tampered with these discreet third parties, you would have control over the world systems,
        with a mindless, souless and spiritless entity.
        Since many of the hackers used these schemes are simply young talents proud of their skills,
        character x seeks support from the cyber division of law enforcements to recruit instead of jailing the hackers tracked down,
        and also attract amd motivate the hackers out there that positive computer skills are more ingenious than the negative ones.
        Character x, shows that if these young talents are not utilised by the government,
        then there skills are not safe out there in the world.
        <!--The systems are meant to be intelligently as close to humans as possible.
        After the successful market supply of its products, 
        the company now initiates installing spyware in the products.
        Character x finds content online for conspiracy theories of products found to be surveillance spyware studying human behaviour.
        Concerned by this, character x suspiciously makes a check for the products they make 
        and then finds sophisticated miniature cameras, microphones, transmitters, e-t-c
        Character x quitely investigates and finds that the company's managing design department,
        which also engages internal design competition with in the company,
        is a disguised unit that is infact a hub for hackers,
        who take the company innovations and divert them to spyware.
        Character x also finds that this is a shadow company for a conspiring elite group without the knowledge of the majority of its workers.
        Character x's works on the (My Twin Clone program) innovation which is meant to analyse its user 
        and be able to replicate their personality as if it were there clone.
        The company has been working unsuccessfully for a long time on its dream of a large scale advanced autonomous program (the digital frankenstein) which is meant to be sentient 
        and if successful character x fears that clone program would be intergrated with it and then in the presence of malicious hacking,
        the future for humanity would be negatively unpredictable.
        Character x down grades the work on the clone program and objects to the company's dream  
        that would risk giving sentience and large scale control to a mindless, souless and spiritless entity.
        Character x privately simulates to the hacking team for the managing design department the danger in the company conspiracy.
        Since most hackers are more proud of their skills than the purpose of their skills, 
        character x convinces the team that positive the positive skills are more ingenious than the negative skills.
        Because the elite group is invicible and finding that it is not the only group in these conspiracies, 
        they agree to stay working under cover minimising the threat the company might pose in the coming future.
        Character x negotiates with the law enforcements (cyber sector) and by low profile begin a campaign of Utilising the hackers caught instead of arresting them.
        Reverse engineering their potential for good like hacking into down human, drugs, arms trafficking circles.
        Character x finds the clone program to be helpful in things like psychology and pyshiatry therapies.
        Thus introducing the idea of instead of Artificial Intelligence being a fancy sentient entity,
        it could be a function before design rather than design before function for the extension of human potential.-->

      <h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>
        Here we have the highlights of the production plans from the literary bible of the log lines from the content page,
        and these are snippets showing how the production plan would flow. <br> <br>
        
        Insecurity: <br>
        The funding for this action film would rely mostly in stunts as the (plot device) on the production side of the film. <br>
        
        Production plan: <br>
        This requires investing a lot of time in research and instruction for fitness and martial arts realistic techniques.
        These would be inspired from things like Calisthenics, Parkour, Krav maga, e-t-c 
        with misrepresented styles (like Wu Xi martial arts) in the form of Tai Chi, Wing Chun, e-t-c to demonstrate what is real and fake.
        Utilising things like, real gun disarming from people like Victor Marx, effective shooting methods like the IDF Isosceles stance method, e-t-c. <br> <br>

        High Population: <br>
        This political business drama is a bigger budget and also larger in scale 
        so the production side plot device of the film would rely on creative crafts. <br>
        
        Production plan: <br>
        Funding and research would be spent on cheap recycling methods for making creative products from wasted material.
        Plastic, polythene, paper are all part of garbage material for recycle and design various things in fashion,
        Utilising Skills and methods from channels like 5 minute crafts, <br> <br>

        Machine labour: <br> 
        The science fiction business drama is a bigger budget with the production side plot device 
        of a technological feat that requires the latest up to date innovative concepts in the engineering industry. <br>
        
        Production plan: <br>
        This involves much research in the robotics of heavy equipment and down to desktop equipment. <br> <br>

        Artificial Intelligence: <br>
        This AI sy-fy crime is also a bigger budget whose production side plot device is a technological feat 
        requiring the latest up to date innovative concepts in the computer industry. <br>
      
        Production plan: <br>
        This requires technical research into advanced software programs along with their advanced hard ware accessories such as supercomputers.
