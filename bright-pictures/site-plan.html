        THEMES <br>
        Here are some of the themes among the concerns in the world which require a good touch from the film industry. <br> <br>

        Insecurity: <br>
        Insecurity eventually ends down to the individual because law enforcements would not be everywhere all the time. <br>
        Mediocre self-defence skills which are now becoming more common are a risk to the practitioners if faced with danger. <br>
        Providing authentic survival skills and regularly improving them reduces the chances of insecurity. <br>
        And screening the people receiving the training to prevent the wrong people who rather than protecting themselves, 
        they may instead victimise others. <br>
        Neglecting military personnel in elite units after their service results to them transferring their skills to elaborate crime.
        Catering for these people with something like veteran community support programs would be beneficial. <br> <br>

        High Population: <br>
        The main concern for high population is scarcity of resources. <br>
        High population is more advantageous than disadvantageous, 
        If the global powers (big governments/ big companies) are less interested in ruling over or controlling the world 
        and more interested in managing it. <br>
        With environmental conservation and good recycling systems, 
        resources would not be scarce however much the population grows. 
        The Earth was created to support life in all its diversity. 
        The more the people the greater the creativity and diversity of humanity. <br> <br>

        Machine Labour: <br>
        The major concern here is that machines will replace humans at work. <br>
        Machine labour should solve human problems but not make abnormal profits. <br>
        Machines should replace humans with risky tasks at work like working in mines, harsh environments. <br>
        And humans should be allocated to the rest of all the less risky tasks at work. <br/> <br>

        Artificial Intelligence: <br>
        Computers will rule the world in the future is one of the speculations that is major concern.
        But if taken seriously, Artificial Intelligence is as dangerous as the programmers behind them. 
        It is the programmers with ambitions to rule the world that attempt to build mailicious programs.  
        So the concern should not be on computers but on the programmers.
        Have an environment for ethical programming then you will have ethical artificial intelligence. <br>

      </ul>
      <h3>CONTENT</h3>
      <p>
        Although there are various good ways to portray the themes mentioned in the home page, <br> 
        we have snippets below to give sample content of what the plots of bigger structured screenplays could be focused on. <br> <br>
        
        Insecurity: <br>
        The insecurity theme could be made under the action film genre. <br>

        Snippet: <br>
        Character X is a fitness and martial arts expert who after experiencing a series of falling a victim of mediocre self-defence
         from average standard schools brought more harm than good in big threat scenarios. 
        And made multiple failed attempts of finding a martial arts school which counter the big realistic threats out there in the world. 
        Through circumstances of the hustling experience, 
        Character X achieved the desired martial arts skills 
        and as an expert strives to make these skills easily accessible to those who are only exposed to the mediocre self defence skills. 
        Unlike the popular hero that saves the day, character X not only saves those in danger but also shows them to save themselves out of danger. <br> <br>

        High Population: <br>        
        The high population theme could be made under the political business drama film genre <br>

        Snippet: <br> 
        Character X is a down to earth business magnet who pursues to join politics without playing dirty games.
        From a background of enduring low living standards in the slums,
        Character x experienced numerous evictions of the poor residents in these conjested slums,
        in name of urbanisation, industralisation or modern development. 
        They would wander and learn to adapt to hustling living conditions in other places.
        In the political and business sphere, 
        these and most of the low class people would be designated as useless consumers populating and filling the world.
        Character x crafted wasted material into useful products and later had a group to eventually become a business workshop
        to supply the low class market at significantly low costs. 
        In the face of the state of the lower class, character x put commitment and dedication into expanding the workshop,
        and use all the creativity, talents and gifts from the people to build most of the requirements needed to sustain these low societies. 
        Since the low class people are the biggest percentage, character x's business became a threat to the larger companies market.
        And attempting to decampaign the business by lobbying its ban by the excuse of unhealthy working standards and products. 
        The drama continues as the business receives health consultations and methodologies motivating character x into a bigger campaign of transforming the waste lands
        polluted by the big companies into advanced recycling hubs and green energy residential parks for the low class world. 
        Character x embarks on joining politics to introduce policies for transforming the ghettos, slums, surbubs, waste lands, e-t-c 
        for the benefit of the poor low class residents themselves as an alternative solution for high population which itself is a diversion of the elite wasting the environment.
        Unlike the fellow visionaries who after bringing change are later blinded by new world they have entered or even when not blinded but later die with their achivements, 
        Character x rests this vision unto the Lord and prepares a trusted potential diversity of successors to grow and progress it even further.

        Machine labour: <br>        
        The machine labour theme could be made under the science fiction business drama film genre. <br>

        Snippet: <br>
        Character X is a robotics engineer who works at a successful robotics company making robotic equipment for domestic use.
        The company is so successful that it is also commissioned to design robot equipment for industrial use.
        Since the industrial market is larger and more profitable, the company now focuses on the industrial market.
        The company expands to the commercial market as well so that along with the rest of the robotic companies supply,
        the robotic industry replaces the humans in routine jobs for big companies.
        Character x's dream was for the robotic innovation to simply lives for the future of humanity,
        but now many workers are loosing jobs because of it.
        Character x's concern is dismissed because machine labour is cheaper than human labour.
        Character x is dismissed from work due to the reluctuancy to design more innovations.
        Finding people working in harsh conditions and environments gives character x an idea of making the dream come true.
        Designing robotic equipment for risky tasks, co-working with humans for assistance in less risky tasks and let humans work in no risk tasks at all.
        Character x embarks on introducing this idea and convince the upcoming enterprenuers and influencing government policy to support them.
        Unlike the previous dream of simplifying life but at a cost of the bigger part of humanity,
        Character x extended the dream for the whole of humanity. <br> <br>

        Artificial intelligence: <br>
        The Artificial Intelligence theme could be made under the science fiction crime film genre. <br>
      
        Snippet: <br>
        Character X is a computer programmer working for a software company which builds domestic autonomous systems.
        The systems are meant to be intelligently as close to humans as possible.
        After the successful market supply of its products, 
        the company now initiates installing spyware in the products.
        Character x finds content online for conspiracy theories of products found to be surveillance spyware studying human behaviour.
        Concerned by this, character x suspiciously makes a check for the products they make 
        and then finds sophisticated miniature cameras, microphones, transmitters, e-t-c
        Character x quitely investigates and finds a disguised unit in a company that is a hub for malicious hackers,
        who take the company innovations and divert them to spyware.
        Character x also finds that it is a shadow company for an elite group without the knowledge of the majority of its workers.
        Character x's (My Twin Clone program) innovation is in progress which is meant to

      <h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>
        These production highlights are basic, making limited to the snippets from the content page. <br> <br>
        
        Insecurity: <br>
        The funding for the action film from the snippet in the content page would rely mostly in stunts for the quality of the film. <br>
        
        Highlight: <br>
        This requires investing a lot of time in research and instruction for fitness and martial arts realistic techniques. <br>
        These would be inspired from things like Calisthenics, Parkour, Krav maga, e-t-c with misrepresented styles (like Wu Xi martial arts) in the form of Tai Chi, Wing Chun, e-t-c to demonstrate what is real and fake. <br>
        Utilising things like, real gun disarming from people like Victor Marx, effective shooting methods like the IDF Isosceles stance method, e-t-c. <br> <br>
