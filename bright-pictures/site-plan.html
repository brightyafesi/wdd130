        THEMES <br>
        Here are some of the themes among the concerns in the world which require a good touch from the film industry. <br> <br>

        Insecurity: <br>
        Insecurity eventually ends down to the individual because law enforcements would not be everywhere all the time. <br>
        Mediocre self-defence skills which are now becoming common are a risk to the practitioners if faced with danger. <br>
        Providing authentic survival skills and regularly improving them reduces the chances of insecurity. <br>
        And screening the people receiving the training to prevent the wrong people who rather than protecting themselves, they may instead victimise others. <br>
        Neglecting military personnel in elite units after their service results to them transferring their skills to elaborate crime.
        Catering for these people with something like veteran community support programs would be beneficial. <br> <br>

        High population: <br>
        The main concern for high population is scarcity of resources. <br>
        High population is more advantageous than disadvantageous, If the global powers (big governments/ big companies) are less interested in ruling over or controlling the world and more interested in managing the world. <br>
        With environmental conservation and good recycling systems, resources would not be scarce however much the population grows. 
        The Earth was created to support life in all its diversity. The more the people the greater the creativity and diversity of humanity. <br> <br>

        Machine labour: <br>
        The major concern here is that machines will replace humans at work. <br>
        Machine labour should solve human problems but not make abnormal profits. <br>
        Machines should replace humans with risky tasks at work like working in mines, harsh environments. <br>
        And humans should be allocated to the rest of all the less risky tasks at work. <br/> <br>

        Artificial intelligence: <br>
        The major concern here is that computers will rule the world.
        Artificial intelligence is as dangerous as the programmers behind them. 
        It is the programmers with ruling and controlling the world ambitions who would build such programs.  
        So the concern should not be on computers but on the programmers.
        Have an environment for ethical programming then you will have ethical artificial intelligence. <br>

      </ul>
      <h3>CONTENT</h3>
      <p>
        Although there are various good ways to portray the themes mentioned in the home page, <br> 
        we have snippets below to give sample content of what the plots of bigger structured screenplays could be focused on. <br> <br>
        
        Insecurity: <br>
        The insecurity theme could be made under the action film genre. <br>

        Snippet: <br>
        Character X is a fitness and martial arts expert who after experiencing a series of falling a victim of mediocre self-defence from average standard schools brought more harm than good in big threat scenarios. <br> 
        And made multiple failed attempts of finding a martial arts school which counter the big realistic threats out there in the world. <br>
        By circumstance, Character X achieved the desired martial arts skills and as an expert strives to make these skills easily accessible to those who are only exposed to the mediocre self defence skills. <br>
        Unlike the popular hero that saves the day, character X not only saves those in danger but also shows them to save themselves out of danger. <br> <br>

        <!-- High Population: <br> 
        
        The high population theme could be made under the political business drama film genre <br>

        Snippet: <br> <br>

        Machine labour: <br> 
        
        The machine labour theme could be made under the science fiction business drama film genre. <br>

        Snippet:

        Artificial intelligence: <br>

        The Artificial Intelligence theme could be made under the science fiction crime film genre. <br> -->

      </ul>
      <h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>
        Note that the production highlights below are partial and basic which means they are limited to the snippets from the content page. <br> <br>
        
        Insecurity: <br>
        The funding for the action film from the snippet in the content page would rely mostly in stunts for the quality of the film. <br>
        
        Highlight: <br>
        This requires investing a lot of time in research and instruction for fitness and martial arts realistic techniques. <br>
        These would be inspired from things like Calisthenics, Parkour, Krav maga, e-t-c with misrepresented styles (like Wu Xi martial arts) in the form of Tai Chi, Wing Chun, e-t-c to demonstrate what is real and fake. <br>
        Utilising things like, real gun disarming from people like Victor Marx, effective shooting methods like the IDF Isosceles stance method, e-t-c. <br> <br>
