    <p>Greetings</p>
    <p>
        My common name is Bright and my formal name is Yafesi Nabende. 
        I am a bachelor pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Technology at BYU-Idaho as an online student living in Uganda (Eastern African Time GMT +3 / UTC +3). 
        I am grateful to study at BYU-Idaho because of its favourable learning conditions and costs.
        It is an advantage for me to learn web design since most of the things in this contemporary world are leaned towards the internet and apps.
        From this course, I hope to be a web developer as part of my career.
    </p>
    <p>    
        I am a slow learner having an interest in computer programming and other computer ware.
        Graphics design, Visual and Auditory illusion, Film Making and Production, martial arts, mystery along with various phenomenon are with in my area of interest. 
        I am grateful to join you all in this class. 
    </p>
